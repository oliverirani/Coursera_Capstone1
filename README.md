This is the repository for the IBM data science professional certificate final project

### Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.
This project is about analyzing the severity of collisions in Seattle area in the USA. As part of this capstone project we will be developing a predictions model to predict the collisions severity in Seattle area in the United States of America. The main problem: What is the severity magnitude for a collision to occur in Seattle?

### Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using.
This dataset contains about 6.5 mln car collisions records. The data include all types of collisions. Collisions will display at the intersection or mid-block of a segment. The data are collected from a timeframe of 2004 to Present. The data is updated on a weekly basis and is provided by SPD and recorded by Traffic Records.
