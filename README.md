This project is about analyzing the severity of accidents in the USA. As part of this capstone project we will be developing a predictions model using techniques such as machine learning to predict the accidents severity in the United States of America. The main problem: What is the severity magnitude for an accident to occur in the United States of America?

### Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using.
